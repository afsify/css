# CSS Animations

**Description**: CSS animations allow you to animate transitions between different styles over time. They are useful for adding interactive visual feedback and enhancing user experiences on web pages.

### Key Properties for CSS Animations

1. **@keyframes**
   - Defines the sequence of styles that an element will go through during the animation.
   - Use percentages (e.g., `0%`, `50%`, `100%`) or keywords (`from`, `to`) to specify the progress stages.

   - **Example**:
     ```css
     @keyframes slideIn {
         from {
             transform: translateX(-100%);
         }
         to {
             transform: translateX(0);
         }
     }
     ```

2. **animation-name**
   - Specifies the name of the `@keyframes` you want to apply to an element.
   - If not set, the animation will not run.

   - **Example**:
     ```css
     .box {
         animation-name: slideIn;
     }
     ```

3. **animation-duration**
   - Defines the time (in seconds or milliseconds) it takes to complete one cycle of the animation.
   - Default is `0s`, meaning the animation does not run if `animation-duration` is not specified.

   - **Example**:
     ```css
     .box {
         animation-duration: 2s;
     }
     ```

4. **animation-timing-function**
   - Controls the speed curve of the animation.
   - Common values:
     - `linear`: Constant speed from start to end.
     - `ease`: Starts slow, speeds up, then slows down.
     - `ease-in`: Starts slow.
     - `ease-out`: Ends slow.
     - `ease-in-out`: Starts and ends slow.
     - `cubic-bezier(n, n, n, n)`: Custom speed curve.

   - **Example**:
     ```css
     .box {
         animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
     }
     ```

5. **animation-delay**
   - Specifies the wait time before the animation starts after it has been applied.
   - Positive values create a delay, and negative values make the animation start partway through.

   - **Example**:
     ```css
     .box {
         animation-delay: 1s;
     }
     ```

6. **animation-iteration-count**
   - Specifies the number of times the animation should repeat.
   - Use values like `1`, `3`, or `infinite` (for looping indefinitely).

   - **Example**:
     ```css
     .box {
         animation-iteration-count: infinite;
     }
     ```

7. **animation-direction**
   - Controls the direction of the animation on alternate iterations.
   - Options:
     - `normal`: Animation runs forward.
     - `reverse`: Animation runs backward.
     - `alternate`: Animation alternates between normal and reverse on each iteration.
     - `alternate-reverse`: Animation alternates starting in reverse.

   - **Example**:
     ```css
     .box {
         animation-direction: alternate;
     }
     ```

8. **animation-fill-mode**
   - Defines how the animation applies styles to the target before and after execution.
   - Options:
     - `none`: Default. No styles are applied outside the animation’s execution.
     - `forwards`: Retains the final style after the animation ends.
     - `backwards`: Applies starting styles during the animation delay.
     - `both`: Applies both `forwards` and `backwards` styles.

   - **Example**:
     ```css
     .box {
         animation-fill-mode: forwards;
     }
     ```

9. **animation-play-state**
   - Controls the play status of an animation. Can be set to `running` or `paused`.
   - This property is useful for starting, stopping, or resuming animations dynamically.

   - **Example**:
     ```css
     .box {
         animation-play-state: paused;
     }
     ```

### Shorthand Property: `animation`

All the above properties can be combined into one shorthand property:
```css
animation: slideIn 2s ease-in-out 1s 3 normal forwards;
```

### Example: Basic CSS Animation

Here’s an example of an animated box that slides in from the left and changes color.

```html
<div class="box"></div>
```

```css
@keyframes slideAndFade {
    0% {
        transform: translateX(-100%);
        opacity: 0;
    }
    50% {
        opacity: 0.5;
    }
    100% {
        transform: translateX(0);
        opacity: 1;
    }
}

.box {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: steelblue;
    animation: slideAndFade 3s ease-in-out 1 forwards;
}
```

### Chaining Multiple Animations

You can chain animations by listing multiple `@keyframes` and their properties, separated by commas.
```css
.box {
    animation: slideIn 2s ease, fadeIn 3s ease-in-out;
}
```

### Controlling Animation with JavaScript

CSS animations can be controlled with JavaScript by modifying properties like `animation-play-state`.

```javascript
const box = document.querySelector('.box');
box.style.animationPlayState = 'paused'; // Pause animation
box.style.animationPlayState = 'running'; // Resume animation
```

### Practical Uses of CSS Animations

1. **Loading Spinners**
   - Rotate or pulse animations for loaders.
   
2. **Button Hover Effects**
   - Subtle scaling or color changes on hover to enhance interactivity.

3. **Image Sliders and Galleries**
   - Sliding or fading effects between images.

4. **Text Animation**
   - Text highlights, fade-ins, or typewriter effects for storytelling.

5. **Attention Grabbing**
   - Bounce or shake effects to draw attention to important content.

### Tips for Effective CSS Animations

- **Keep animations short**: Long animations can slow down page interactions.
- **Use easing functions for realism**: Choose appropriate timing functions to create more natural movements.
- **Optimize performance**: Animate properties like `transform` and `opacity`, as they perform better compared to properties like `width` or `height`.
- **Test on multiple devices**: Ensure animations work well on both desktop and mobile.

### Performance Considerations

- **Avoid excessive animations**: Too many animations can affect performance, especially on mobile.
- **Hardware acceleration**: Properties like `transform` and `opacity` are GPU-accelerated, making them ideal for smoother animations.
- **Reduce reflows and repaints**: Limit animations on properties that trigger layout recalculations, like `width`, `height`, and `position`.
